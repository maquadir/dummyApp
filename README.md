## Welcome!


Follow the [install instructions](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/) to setup Flutter.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the official [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Here are a few resources we've found useful to get started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

Clone your repository

    git clone https://github.com/work-for-amaysim/flutter-take-home-test-<YOUR_USERNAME>.git
    
Install dependencies

    cd app && flutter pub get

Launch a simulator and run the demo app

    open -a simulator
    flutter run --debug

## About the demo app

The demo application connects to `https://dummyjson.com/` to get a single product.

With [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/), you get different types of REST Endpoints filled with JSON data which you can use while developing without worrying about writing any backend.

Check out the [dummyjson.com docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs) for usage examples to help you focus on building a cool app experience.

## Exercises

Choose an exercise(s) that matches you. This is the area in which you feel the most comfortable and have the highest degree of mastery. [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) has APIs for all of these.
